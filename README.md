# Electronic Commerce is exactly analogous to a marketplace on the internet. Electronic commerce (also referred to as EC, e-commerce) consist primarily of the distributing, buying, selling, marketing and servicing of products or services over electronic systems such as the internet and other computer networks. E-commerce follows – that is, buyers and sellers exchange and transport goods from one place to another. But rather than conducting business in the tradition way-in stores and other “brick and mortar” buildings or through mail order catalogs and telephone operators- in e-commerce buyers and sellers transact business over networked computers.
